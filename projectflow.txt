Building pipeline:
1. Create a Github repo and clone it in local (add experiments)
2. Add src folder along with all components(run them individually)
3. Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4. Now git add, commit, push 

setting up dvc pipeline (without params)
5. Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
6. dvc init then then do dvc repro to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
7. Now git add, commit, push
